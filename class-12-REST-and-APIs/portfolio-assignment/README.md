# Portfolio Assignment for Class 12 - REST and API's

In our blog, we used RESTful routes to interact with the Github API.  It's time to take this a step further and integrate this functionality into your portfolio project.

To get started, you will need to create a controller that includes a call to the Github API. This call should grab data about your individual account and render portions of the returned content, to the page, **once the data has been loaded**.  This is fairly open ended, so use the whatever data you deem fit and be sure to separate your concerns.

*Note - You will also need to style this new addition and make sure that it is fully responsive.*
